## CUHK VISULIZATION
You can follow our experiment to visualize the CUHK-SYSU dataset, however, this dataset has too many (more than 6000) identities. cuml TSNE failed to visualize it with the default settting. sklearn TSNE works a little better than cuml, but still not such good. TSNE visualize is a torture, if you interested in the visualization, you can try to help us fine tuning it.
